          <h3>My path</h3>
          <p>
            My focus for years was on running my pre-school and yoga business.
            The pandemic changed many things.
          </p>
          <p>
            I remained positive and seized the opportunity to commit: to
            learning coding and finance. I concentrated on web development with
            great enthusiasm, drive, grit and mentorship.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, I remain focused on my quest to work as a Software Developer.
            I continue to leverage code challenges, pre-designed projects, and
            mock real-time interviews with my mentorsâ€¦ all to informally train
            and practice my newly acquired skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            I belong in tech: I love logic, efficiency, problem-solving, and
            living on the cutting edge.
